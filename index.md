#Welcome to the CLAM Family!

The CLAM Project is an open source, peer-to-peer, pseudonymous, community driven value transfer system.  It allows individuals to make payments and transfer value without permission or censorship.

---

##Open Source

The software that runs the CLAM network is free and open source.  Anyone can review and improve the code.

---

##Peer-to-Peer

The CLAM network is maintained and validated by the community who uses it.  There is no central bank or corporation.

---

##Pseudonymous

There is no sign-up or user system in the CLAM network.  Users use cryptography to create keys which control "coins"/CLAMs at randomly generated addresses.

---

##Community Driven

CLAMs would not exist today if not for the contribution and support of the community.  Thank you.
