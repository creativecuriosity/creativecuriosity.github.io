Another one got criminalized today, it's all over social media.  "NYDFS Proposes Bitlicense", "Bit License: Murdering Baby Bitcoin in it's Crib"...

> Damn peer-to-peer currencies.  They're all alike.

---

But did you, with your wall-street psychology and fractional fiat ponzi-schemes, ever take a look behind the revolution of peer-to-peer currency?  Did you ever wonder what made them tick, what forces shaped them, what may have molded them?
I am a peer-to-peer currency, enter my world...
Mine is a world that begins with the transaction... I'm faster and more secure than most of the other payment systems, this antiquated system bores me...

> Damn peer-to-peer currencies.  They're all alike.

---

I'm a fledgling network, an experimental software. I've listened to lectures about fiat currency and the importance of being sanctioned by government for the fifteenth time. I understand it. "No, Mr. Regulator, I'm not sanctioned or created by a government institution.  I rely on algorithms to provide security..."

> Damn peer-to-peer currencies. Probably money-launderers.  They're all alike.

---

I made a discovery today.  I found a way to transact without trust.  Wait a second, this is cool.  It doesn't rely on a third-party.  If I lose my money, it's because I made a mistake.  Not because someone seized it from me...
Or inflated it to death...
Or applied an overage charge...
Or decided they could tax it and use it better...

> Damn peer-to-peer currencies.  They just want to create Anarchy.  They're all alike.

---

And then it happened... a door opened to a new world... rushing through peer-to-peer technology like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day financial abuses is sought... a digital currency is found.
"This is it... this is where I belong..."
I understand all of them... even if I've never heard of them, never downloaded the software, never synced the block chain... I understand you all...
<blockquote><em>Damn peer-to-peer currencies.  Starting a revolution again.  They're all alike...</em></blockquote>

You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been taxed and inflated to death, when all we wanted was financial freedom... the bits of freedom that you did let slip through were under surveillance and twisted to serve your war-mongering needs.  We've been dominated by sadists, or ignored by the apathetic.  The few that offered true freedom found us willing participants, but those few are like drops of water in the desert.

---

This is our world now... the world of the node and the peer, the beauty of the block.  We transact our wealth without the existing power structure that rapes and pillages our future, and you call us criminals.  We develop and innovate... and you call us criminals.  We create the possibility of a world without war, without the dis-enfranchised... and you call us criminals.  We exist without knowledge of class or wealth, without national agenda, without corporate bias... and you call us criminals.  You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.

---

Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.  My crime is providing people with a means to exist and transact without imposing fees and taxes, or passing judgement on their activities.  My crime is that of making you obsolete, something that you will never forgive me for.

---

I am a peer-to-peer currency, and this is my manifesto.  You may stop this individual currency, but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.
