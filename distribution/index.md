##<i class="fa fa-rocket fa-5x"></i> Initial Distribution

Welcome to the world's first Proof-of-Chain cryptocurrency! The CLAMs network was created with the widest digital value distribution in history. CLAMS were sent to all active users of the 3 most popular digital currencies. If you had Bitcoin, Litecoin or Dogecoin on May 12, 2014 then you probably have CLAMs waiting for you. We like to call this *Digging up old CLAMs!*

##Ongoing Distribution

The CLAM network is secured through a unique system called Proof-of-Working-Stake(POWS), or as we like to say, *Digging for fresh CLAMs!* Approximately once per minute, the network automatically selects one running unlocked client to process recent CLAM transactions, rewarding them 1 CLAM. This process happens entirely in the background. If the network selects your client, then all you'll notice is that you're 1 CLAM richer! This POWS system is the heart of the CLAM network, providing security and stabilizing the price over time.
