##CLAMS are a new kind of cryptocurrency

Bitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency, made possible by a radically new sofware technology called the "blockchain". This software is open-source; free and available to all who wish to build upon it. Many people have done so, creating thousands of new cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.

Most of these new coins are just rebranded copies. A very few, like CLAMS, are highly innovate variations of the original bitcoin code. What all these cryptocurrencies have in common is their beating heart; a blockchain.

People like yourself run CLAMS software all over the world, forming one giant decentralized network. Opposite to centralized networks, the more people who join the CLAMS network, the stronger it gets.

The combined computing power of the CLAMS network is used to create and maintain the blockchain, where all CLAMS transactions are processed. Unlike banks, there are no middlemen in cryptocurrency. It's just us and the network, freed from tyranny!
